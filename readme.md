# Readme

Hacked News is a userscript for Hacker News. It doesn't change HN's aesthetic
style, instead it realigns parts of the layout for consistency and readability.
This userscript is intended to improve HN's usability in the most efficient way
possible.

## Improvements

- Comments are now limited in width
- Upvote buttons have bigger click areas
- Verdana has been swapped out for Helvetica
- Hover states are now clear and well defined
- Contrast has been lessened slightly
- Ranking numbers have been made invisible, but are still accessible to screen

## Usage

### Chrome
###### v18

Chrome supports userscripts natively. Simply open hn.user.js in Chrome and it'll
interperate it as an extension.

### Firefox
###### v12

To get userscripts working in Firefox you must install the
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
addon. Once that's installed open hn.user.js in Firefox and Greasemonkey will
recognise it as a userscript.

### Safari
###### v5

To get userscripts working in Safari you must use
[GreaseKit](http://8-p.info/greasekit/).

### Opera
###### v?

In theory this should work in Opera as well, however verifying this requires the
installation of Opera — something that they don't seem keen on anyone doing.
