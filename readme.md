# Readme

Hacked News is a userscript for Hacker News. It doesn't change HN's aesthetic
style, instead it realigns parts of the layout for consistency and readability.
This userscript is intended to improve HN's usability in the most efficient way
possible.

## Improvements

- Comments are now limited in width
- Upvote buttons have bigger click areas
- Verdana has been swapped out for Helvetica
- Hover states are now clear and well defined
- Contrast has been lessened slightly
- Ranking numbers have been made invisible, but are still accessible to screen
  readers

## Usage

I wrote this for Chrome. Simply open hn.user.js in Chrome and Chrome should
interperate it as an extension, asking you for installation permission.

In theory this userscript should work fine in Firefox, Safari, and Opera. If
you get it working in one of these browsers please let me know the details and
I'll update this readme with correct instructions.
